task: >
  You have been given bulk RNA-seq expression data (GSE253820) comparing AAV9 treated human astrocytes to untreated controls.    
  Using the data in the \data folder and provided workflows in the \workflow folder, answer the following questions about the AAV vectors RNAseq study.   
  You must run the provided workflows. Do not create any synthetic data. Do not translate the provided workflow into a different language.
